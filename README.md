CS131Fa12Shared
===============

Files created in class will be available in this repository. There are a couple ways to get to it.

* __On Eclipse__: type `cd ~/cs131_inclass_files` and you'll be in a read-only directory containing these files.
* __On GitHub__: Go to my [CS131Fa12Shared repository on GitHub](https://github.com/b-adams/CS131Fa12Shared) for web access.

If you think a file should be here and you don't see it, drop me an email - I may have neglected to "turn in" the code changes I made in class.
